## Laboratory Assistant

I am a student studying Molecular and Cell Biology at UC Berkeley, interested in the intersection of healthcare and biotechnology. Currently, I work at the Flow Cytometry Core Facility at Berkeley's Cancer Research Laboratory, where I train researchers and those from industry in advanced flow analysis and FACS. Now joining the Calderon Lab as an undergraduate lab assistant, I look forward to deepening my experience across various disciplines and to apply my skills to support the labâ€™s ongoing projects. 

In my free time I like to review restaurants around the Bay Area and design floral arrangements (bouquets / ikebana) with my friends at Cal!
